You're improving the Unalon website. The current version has some serious UX/UI issues and feature bugs that need to be addressed. Please make the following changes:

🔁 GENERAL UI/UX FIXES
Ads Redesign

Replace current colorful ads with subtle, elegant "story-style" ad-notifications.

Ads should blend with the app's aesthetic — minimalist, pastel-based, unobtrusive.

Inject these ads organically between event posts, not in fixed banners.

Mark them as "Sponsored" in a cool, non-intrusive font and position.

Header Consistency (My Plans Page)

On the My Plans page, replace the heading "Unalon" with "My Plans" to avoid redundant titles and improve clarity.

Search Button Fix

Make sure the search bar is functional. It should:

Allow filtering by location, interest, or username.

Provide instant suggestions in dropdown.

Include a loading animation if necessary.

✍️ CREATE FLOW FIXES
Auto-Accept Button Logic

Show the "Auto-Accept" toggle/button only after the user enters the number of participants.

Create Event Popup

Transform the “Create” page into a modal popup without a full page header.

Keep it clean, compact, floating with a blur or fade background effect.

Ensure smooth animations.

Sponsored Places List

In the create modal’s “Select a Place” dropdown, list a few sponsored places at the top.

Clearly label them “Sponsored” but style it aesthetically to match Unalon’s theme (e.g., faint italic with a star icon).

💬 CHAT & PROFILE ENHANCEMENTS
Stories on Chat Page

On top of the chat window, display a horizontal stories bar showing avatars of friends who’ve posted recently.

Clicking on a story shows event memories, hangout recaps, or ads from friends’ fav spots.

Requested Event Logic Fix

Events should not appear as ‘Requested’ by default.

After clicking "Request", it changes to "Requested".

Clicking "Requested" again should do nothing to avoid unintentional toggling.

Profile Icon Relocation

Move the profile icon to the top navigation bar, next to the notifications bell, for intuitive access.

🔔 NOTIFICATION PAGE FIXES
Notifications Page Functionality

Fix the notifications page—it currently doesn’t load or respond.

It should show:

Friend requests

Event invites

Accepted applications

Stories tagged by friends

Ads from sponsored places

Ad Integration in Notifs

Blend in ads for cafes or popular hangout spots into the notifications feed.

Style them like friendly messages, e.g., “🍰 Riya just went to Mocha Mojo! Wanna join her next time?”

Subtle CTA buttons like "Check it out" or "Add to wishlist".

🔚 Final polish: Keep animations smooth, transitions intuitive, and visuals cohesive with Unalon’s theme: ethereal, soft, clean, and next-gen social.
