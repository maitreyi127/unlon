Update the Unalon web application UI/UX and frontend logic with the following improvements and bug fixes. Use modular, reusable components where possible and maintain consistency with the existing design system (minimalist, pastel, soft UI).

✅ 1. Ad Integration (Remove from Homepage, Add to Notifications)
Remove all ad banners or blocks from the homepage feed.

Inject ad content as styled notifications in the /notifications page only.

Style ads like user activity (e.g., "Anaya just visited Blue Tokai ☕").

Add a "Sponsored" tag — subtle, small italic grey text or emoji like ✨.

Use the same card style and layout as other notifications.

Do not use colorful or jarring ad blocks.

✅ 2. Search Bar Redesign
Redesign the search bar component across the app to:

Use rounded corners (border-radius: 12px)

Add slight drop shadow or translucent blur background

Embed a small magnifying glass icon inside the left

Placeholder: "Search by name, interest, or location"

Ensure responsiveness and padding looks balanced on all screen sizes

✅ 3. My Plans Heading
On the /myplans route, change the top header text from "Unalon" to "My Plans" to avoid double headings.

Ensure page title and tab also reflect "My Plans" if dynamic routing is used.

✅ 4. Auto-Accept Button Visibility Logic
In the Create Event form:

Hide the “Auto-Accept” toggle by default.

Show it only after a number is entered in the “Number of Participants” input.

Use an event listener on the input field to trigger a conditional render.

Add fade-in animation (opacity + transform: translateY) for smoother UX.

✅ 5. Create Event Modal
Replace the existing full-page Create view with a centered modal popup.

Remove all headers from this modal.

Modal should have:

A soft white or blurred background

Padding, rounded edges, box-shadow

Entrance animation (e.g., fade + scale)

Ensure modal is closable with a × icon or click outside.

✅ 6. Sponsored Places in Create Page
In the Place selection dropdown (Create Event form):

Prepend 2–3 hardcoded or API-tagged places marked as sponsored: true.

Render these first in the dropdown with:

A “Sponsored” label next to the name

Custom style: small, italic, pastel-colored font or icon (e.g., 🌟)

✅ 7. Profile Icon Navigation
Remove the Profile tab/icon from the bottom dock (mobile nav).

Add profile icon to the top-right corner, adjacent to the notifications bell.

Ensure it is clickable and leads to the user's profile page (/profile).

Match icon size and margin with nearby buttons for visual harmony.

✅ 8. Request Button Behavior in Events
For each event card:

Default button text: "Request to Join"

On first click:

Change text to "Requested"

Disable further clicks (either disable the button or make it non-interactive)

Events should never show as “Requested” by default.

✅ 9. Fix Non-Functional Buttons on Notifications Page
Debug and fix all non-working buttons on /notifications.

Accept, Reject, View, or similar buttons must trigger appropriate event handlers.

If missing, add onClick handlers and link to backend routes or client-side state.

Show feedback (e.g., toast, checkmark) after interaction.

✅ 10. Enhanced Notifications with Friend Activity & Sponsored Content
In the Notifications feed:

Include styled notification cards for:

Hangout requests from friends

Confirmations or rejections

Casual updates (e.g., “Priya is planning a study date 📚”)

Sponsored places (like “Nukkad Cafe is trending!”)

Ads should:

Be written as real messages, not banners

Include small CTA buttons like “Check it out” or “Bookmark”

🧪 Notes:
Ensure all animations are smooth (CSS transitions or Framer Motion if using React).

Optimize for responsiveness (use flexbox/grid, media queries).

Use component state and conditional rendering for dynamic logic.

Make sure nothing breaks routing or existing login/session features.
